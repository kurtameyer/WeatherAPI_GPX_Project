# WeatherAPI_GPX_Project

This project will take GPX XML data from some of my longest bicycle rides and extract time and location data (latitude and longitude) in a python script. A separate program will take that information and pass it into weather API calls to extract basic weather information roughly from the top of each hour. Last, a dataframe will be created that lines up the location/time data with the weather data.
